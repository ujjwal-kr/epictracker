# ip-sniff
Demo: https://epictracker.now.sh
- It is a demontstration project of how can I track you using fingerprinting and some automated lookups and stuff.
- It uses modern Javascript APIs to intentify your metadata and keeps the information in a cookie, encrypting it.
- I will make a machine learning algorithm in future which will try to match the encrypted cookies to figure out the target.
- I may create dummy marketing services to demonstrate the (targeted ads) tracking process close to the realworld.
