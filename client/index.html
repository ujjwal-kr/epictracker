            The HASH is a unique identifier for your device configurations so even if you will visit the page in a
            private window or even after you clear your cache, it WON'T change.

            Now I can [I'm not saving] save all this information to my database and this would be perfectly legal, and
            this information
            is enough to identify you accross the web [using the HASH]. This is what other websites do. They track you,
            save all of your
            information to show you ADS. And this will continue with time to get more insane. Some apps
            and device vendors may also be capturing your camera and microphone to get more private information about
            you. Doing this with a browser requires permissions, but I have skipped it due to security reasons.

        <h3>Opt In for a scan?</h3>
        <code>
            Open this website with any other devices from the same network, i.e connected to same wifi, and press the
            "OPT IN FOR SCAN" button. Then press the "SCAN" button from this device. You should see the information of
            all the devices which has opted in for scan in last 30 minutes.
            <br><br>
            This demo shows that all the devices from your network can be identified on the basis of IPs and the
            metadata can be collected.
